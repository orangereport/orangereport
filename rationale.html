            <h2>Actions and Reactions</h2>
            
            <p>The Orange Report focusses on the timing of the actions of US President Donald J. Trump. Most media coverage will discuss particular actions and their consequences in depth. However, this coverage is often difficult to place in a historical context. The timeline provides a visual representation of the decisions made by President Trump.</p>
            <p>Where possible the timeline will list reactions: either legal, civil, or international. Documenting reactions ensures that it becomes easier to keep track of changing positions of President Trump. In general, it will remain bad news for good people.</p>
